Bucket Backups with AWS GUI and Boto3
Learn how to automate backups of S3 buckets using both the AWS Management Console and Boto3. Ensure data redundancy, protection, and availability while streamlining the backup process with error handling, logging, security, and automation.

Automating S3 backups ensures:
- Data Redundancy: Safeguard against accidental deletion or data loss.
- Streamlined Automation: Minimize manual intervention with programmatic backups.
- Improved Disaster Recovery: Facilitate cross-region backups for resilience.
- Integration: Align with DevOps/DevSecOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

Use Cases
- Data Backup and Recovery: Regular backups of critical files for quick recovery.
- Cross-Region Backups: Protect against regional outages by replicating data across AWS regions.
- Versioning and Historical Data Retention: Retain multiple file versions for rollback or compliance.
- CI/CD Integration: Automate artifact and log backups during deployments.
- Security and Compliance: Use encryption and IAM policies to secure backups.

Part 1: Manual Backup Using the AWS Management Console
Steps to Create and Copy Objects Between S3 Buckets
- Log in to AWS Management Console
- Navigate to AWS Management Console and sign in.

Create S3 Buckets
- Navigate to S3.
- Click Create bucket, name the bucket (e.g., my-source-bucket), and configure it as required.
- Repeat to create a second bucket (e.g., my-destination-bucket).
- Upload a File to the Source Bucket
- Open the source bucket and click Upload to add a file (e.g., example.txt).
- Copy the Object to the Destination Bucket
- In the source bucket, select the file and click Actions > Copy.
- Open the destination bucket and paste the file.
Outcome: The file is copied from the source bucket to the destination bucket.

Part 2: Automated Backup Using Boto3
Prerequisites
Install Boto3: pip install boto3
Configure AWS CLI: aws configure
- Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Output format.

File 1: Basic Object Copy with Error Handling and Logging

import boto3
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='s3_backup.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Initialize the S3 resource
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

source_bucket = 'my-source-bucket'
destination_bucket = 'my-destination-bucket'
copy_source = {
    'Bucket': source_bucket,
    'Key': 'example.txt'
}

try:
    s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, destination_bucket, 'example.txt')
    logging.info(f"Successfully copied example.txt from {source_bucket} to {destination_bucket}.")
    print("File copied to backup bucket.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error copying file: {e}")
    print(f"Error copying file: {e}")

File 2: Multi-Bucket Backup for Redundancy

import boto3
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='s3_backup.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

source_bucket = 'my-source-bucket'
destination_buckets = ['my-destination-bucket', 'my-destination-backup-bucket']
copy_source = {
    'Bucket': source_bucket,
    'Key': 'example.txt'
}

for destination_bucket in destination_buckets:
    try:
        s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, destination_bucket, 'example.txt')
        logging.info(f"Successfully copied example.txt to {destination_bucket}.")
        print(f"File copied to {destination_bucket}.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error copying to {destination_bucket}: {e}")
        print(f"Error copying to {destination_bucket}: {e}")

File 3: Backup Versioning

import boto3
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='s3_backup.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

source_bucket = 'my-source-bucket'
destination_bucket = 'my-destination-bucket'
copy_source = {
    'Bucket': source_bucket,
    'Key': 'example.txt'
}
versioned_copy_key = 'example-versioned.txt'

try:
    s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, destination_bucket, versioned_copy_key)
    logging.info(f"Versioned copy of example.txt to {versioned_copy_key} in {destination_bucket}.")
    print(f"Versioned file copied as {versioned_copy_key}.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error during versioned copy: {e}")
    print(f"Error during versioned copy: {e}")

File 4: Adding KMS Encryption

import boto3
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='s3_backup.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

source_bucket = 'my-source-bucket'
destination_bucket = 'my-destination-bucket'
copy_source = {
    'Bucket': source_bucket,
    'Key': 'example.txt'
}

kms_key_id = 'your-kms-key-id'  # Replace with actual KMS key ID

try:
    s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, destination_bucket, 'example.txt',
                        ExtraArgs={'ServerSideEncryption': 'aws:kms', 'SSEKMSKeyId': kms_key_id})
    logging.info(f"Successfully copied and encrypted example.txt using KMS.")
    print("File copied and encrypted with KMS.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error during KMS encrypted copy: {e}")
    print(f"Error during KMS encrypted copy: {e}")

File 5: Automating Backups with Scheduling

import schedule
import time
import boto3
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='s3_backup.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

def backup():
    source_bucket = 'my-source-bucket'
    destination_bucket = 'my-destination-bucket'
    copy_source = {
        'Bucket': source_bucket,
        'Key': 'example.txt'
    }

    try:
        s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, destination_bucket, 'example.txt')
        logging.info(f"Successfully copied example.txt from {source_bucket} to {destination_bucket}.")
        print("Automated backup complete.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error during automated backup: {e}")
        print(f"Error during automated backup: {e}")

# Schedule backup every day at midnight
schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(backup)

# Keep the script running to adhere to schedule
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)

File 6: Cleaning Up Resources

import boto3

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

buckets = ['my-source-bucket', 'my-destination-bucket', 'my-destination-backup-bucket']

for bucket_name in buckets:
    bucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)
    try:
        bucket.objects.all().delete()
        print(f"All objects deleted from {bucket_name}.")
        bucket.delete()
        print(f"{bucket_name} bucket deleted.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error deleting bucket {bucket_name}: {e}")

Summary
Automating S3 bucket backups ensures data availability, redundancy, and security. These scripts leverage Boto3 to implement backup processes with features like multi-bucket redundancy, encryption, versioning, and scheduling. This approach is ideal for Python developers and DevOps/DevSecOps engineers to streamline cloud data management securely and efficiently.
