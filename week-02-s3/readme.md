Working with Storage Buckets
What is a Storage Bucket?
A storage bucket is a cloud-based container used for storing data objects such as files, images, videos, and other forms of digital data. Services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage use buckets as logical units for organizing and managing data efficiently.
Why Was it Developed?

Storage buckets address the challenges of traditional storage systems by providing:

1. Scalability: Dynamically scale storage capacity without hardware changes.
2. Durability and Redundancy: Replicate data across multiple servers and locations for high availability.
3. Cost-Effectiveness: Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces storage costs for fluctuating needs.
4. Accessibility: Access data from anywhere via APIs.

Importance for DevSecOps and Python Developers
For DevSecOps:
1. Security: Offers encryption, access control policies, and audit logging.
2. Automation: Used in CI/CD pipelines to store build artifacts, configuration files, and logs.
3. Backup and Recovery: Enables reliable and automated backups.
4. Data Management: Streamlines data sharing across development, security, and operations.

For Python Developers:
1. Easy Integration: Interact with buckets using SDKs like Boto3.
2. Data Storage: Efficiently manage large datasets.
3. File Management: Automate file handling tasks such as uploading and downloading.
4. Cost-Effective Storage: Avoid physical infrastructure costs.

Why Use Boto3?
Boto3 is AWS’s Python SDK that simplifies interaction with AWS services, including S3. 
Benefits of Boto3:
1. Programmatic Access: Automate tasks such as bucket creation, file management, and permissions.
2. Integration with CI/CD: Store and manage build artifacts in S3 as part of CI/CD pipelines.
3. Data Processing: Process data stored in S3 using Python libraries.
4. Automation: Perform backups, manage policies, and schedule tasks programmatically.
5. Security: Enforce policies and encrypt data.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Create and manage S3 buckets using both the AWS Management Console and Boto3.
- Upload and download files to/from buckets.
- View and delete bucket contents.

Part 1: Using the AWS Management Console
Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
1. Log in to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Navigate to S3 under Services.
3. Click Create bucket.
4. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-bucket`) and select a region.
5. Click Create bucket.

Step 2: Upload a File
1. Click the bucket name.
2. Click Upload → Add files → Select the file.
3. Click Upload.

Step 3: View Bucket Contents
1. Navigate to your bucket in the S3 dashboard.
2. Click on Objects to see the uploaded files.

Step 4: Download a File
1. Select the file you uploaded.
2. Click Download.

Step 5: Delete Bucket Contents and Bucket
1. Delete all files in the bucket.
2. Navigate back to the bucket list.
3. Select the bucket and click Delete.

Part 2: Using Boto3 in Python
Prerequisites
1. Install Boto3: pip install boto3
2. Configure AWS credentials: aws configure

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Create a Python script (create_bucket.py):
import boto3

def create_bucket(bucket_name, region=None):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    if region:
        s3.create_bucket(
            Bucket=bucket_name,
            CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': region}
        )
    else:
        s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
    print(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' created.")

create_bucket('my-bucket', 'us-west-2')
________________________________________
Step 2: Upload a File
Add the following to upload_file.py:
def upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, object_name=None):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, object_name or file_name)
    print(f"Uploaded {file_name} to {bucket_name}/{object_name or file_name}.")

upload_file('example.txt', 'my-bucket')
________________________________________
Step 3: List Bucket Contents
Add the following to list_files.py:
def list_files(bucket_name):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
    for obj in response.get('Contents', []):
        print(obj['Key'])

list_files('my-bucket')
________________________________________
Step 4: Download a File
Add the following to download_file.py:
def download_file(bucket_name, object_name, file_name):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.download_file(bucket_name, object_name, file_name)
    print(f"Downloaded {object_name} to {file_name}.")

download_file('my-bucket', 'example.txt', 'example_downloaded.txt')
________________________________________
Step 5: Delete Bucket and Contents
Add the following to delete_bucket.py:
def delete_all_objects(bucket_name):
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    bucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)
    bucket.objects.all().delete()
    print(f"Deleted all objects in {bucket_name}.")

def delete_bucket(bucket_name):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
    print(f"Deleted bucket {bucket_name}.")

delete_all_objects('my-bucket')
delete_bucket('my-bucket')
